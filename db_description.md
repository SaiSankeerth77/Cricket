### General Observation
The AUTO_INCREMENT attribute is used in primary keys to automatically generate unique identifiers for new records.
The SERIAL keyword in the Matches and MatchResults tables is an alias for BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE.
The database maintains referential integrity through the use of foreign keys with cascade delete rules. When a team is deleted, all related players, matches, and match results are also deleted.
The schema allows for the team_a_id and team_b_id in the Matches table to be null, which could represent situations where a team is no longer part of the league or database.
Functional dependencies indicated by comments (FDs) show the relationship between primary keys and other columns in the tables, confirming which columns are functionally determined by the primary keys.
This database schema is well-suited for a cricket management system where teams, players, matches, and match performances are tracked and maintained. It allows for various types of queries involving joins, aggregations, and data management operations pertinent to organizing and analyzing cricket matches.
